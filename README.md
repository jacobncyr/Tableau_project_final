# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
I wanted to learn more about the fifa soccer players. I was interested in their wages.

## Process
To do this i  analyzed the data and made sure my data columns were correct. I had to convert the nationality data to a measure of lattitude and longitude. From this data i was able to look at the players, their regions and their wages.

## Results
I originally had a few questions about wage, location and effort exerted to the game. i found that there is a slight linear correlation among whether you are young and get paid well or whetheer you are older and get paid a little less well. Some people also make alot of money to play less aggressively, either they are overpaid or really good at effortlessly playing soccer.

## Challenges 
I had no geolocation data and had to convert a column to latitude and longitude. The only other problem i ran into was running out of space i wanted to look at more data scenarios.

## Future Goals
If i had more time i would do more analysis. My small computer screen only allowed me to fit so much onto the dashboard. I would also add animation.
