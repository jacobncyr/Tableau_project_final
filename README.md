# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
I wanted to learn more about the fifa soccer players. I was interested in their wages.

## Process
To do this i  analyzed the data and made sure my data columns were correct. I had to convert the nationality data to a measure of lattitude and longitude. From this data i was able to look at the players, their regions and their wages.

## Results
I originally had a few questions about wage, location and effort exerted to the game. i found that there is a slight linear correlation among whether you are young and get paid well or whetheer you are older and get paid a little less well. Some people also make alot of money to play less aggressively, either they are overpaid or really good at effortlessly playing soccer.
My 5 questions answered were.
1.what is the sum and average players by nationality
2.What is the players average wage and their region. Display the most paid players.
3.which futbol clubs play the best and where d they play?
4.Aggression correlation: who is making money for playing harder and who is making money for talent.
5.is age correlated with pay?
Refer to the story to answer these questions. Explore by using the map as a filter for location in the dashboard.
## Challenges 
I had no geolocation data and had to convert a column to latitude and longitude. The only other problem i ran into was running out of space i wanted to look at more data scenarios.

## Future Goals
If i had more time i would do more analysis. My small computer screen only allowed me to fit so much onto the dashboard. I would also add animation.
