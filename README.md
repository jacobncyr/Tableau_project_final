Final Project - Tableau
Project Goals
The goal of this project was to analyze FIFA soccer player data, specifically focusing on their wages. The project aimed to explore various aspects such as player nationality, wages, and location.

Process
During the analysis, the data was carefully examined and the necessary data columns were identified. One significant task involved converting the nationality data into latitude and longitude coordinates. This geographical information allowed for the visualization of player regions and their corresponding wages.

Results
The analysis addressed several questions related to wages, location, and player performance. The following key findings were observed:

Nationality Analysis: The project calculated the sum and average number of players for each nationality.
Wage and Region: The average wages of players were compared across different regions. The visualization also highlighted the highest-paid players.
Top Performing Clubs: The project identified the top-performing football clubs and their respective locations.
Aggression Correlation: The analysis explored the relationship between player aggression and wages. It highlighted players who earned significant amounts either due to exceptional talent or effortless playing.
Age and Pay: The project investigated the correlation between player age and wages.
To explore these findings further, refer to the project's story. The map can be used as a filter for location in the dashboard.

Challenges
Several challenges were encountered during the project:

Geolocation Data: The absence of geolocation data required converting a column to latitude and longitude coordinates.
Limited Space: Due to space limitations on the dashboard, it was difficult to include additional data scenarios.
Future Goals
Given more time, the project could benefit from additional analysis. Considering the constraints of a small computer screen, expanding the dashboard's capacity and incorporating animation would be beneficial.
